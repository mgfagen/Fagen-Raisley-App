Why would you be a good fit for the Customer Advocate role? 

I love the idea that the Customer Advocate role has so much diversity. I want to be able to solve problems, work with people, be independent, learn new technologies, teach others, touch lives in a positive way and more. Instead of telling you why I think I would be a good fit for this role, I would love to provide some examples. 

Growing up, my family had an orchard. In order to make ends meet we would need to get produce gathered to store and sell. As a young child, I would set achievable goals for myself to pick a specific amount of raspberries before I made it to soccer practice or games (I love soccer). I would try to pick 18 pints (3 baskets worth), knowing that this would bring in about $50. Not only was I learning how to set goals, I was learning how to achieve success through hard work. To this day, I cannot put down a task without putting in all of my effort to accomplish it. Whether this means trouble shooting technology (ahem getting my computer to finally connect to the internet), figuring out a way to de-escalate my 3 year old so we can finish our gymnastics class, or even googling how to change a fuse in my car so that my radio will work again. 

My brother, Andrew, has Down Syndrome. I knew we would lead different paths, but I always wanted to be present in his life. In college, I worked at a non profit camp called Camp Albrecht Acres. My brother loved this camp for individuals with special needs, so I knew that he would feel special with me working there as a counselor. When I thought I was making a huge impact on people, I was actually being taught lesson after lesson of empathy, kindness, compassion and patience. Along the way I even learned how to de-escalate situations (most of which were camper behavior related). All of this translates into being customer oriented. I want to focus on the customer and their needs, but also be open minded with how they can teach me too. 

In order to apply to this position, I had to teach myself how to write html code. Instead of asking my husband who is a Senior Quality Engineer, I decided to use the power of the internet myself. I discovered that I really enjoy learning about html and css, I am very grateful for www.w3schools.com. Even though I have accomplished this simple site, I am going to continue to learn from this site because I want to learn more.  I am self motivated and very determined. 

I believe in technology. Everywhere we turn there is technology, any type of screen (phones, TVs, ads on the highway, tablets, etc.),  medical equipment, echo, automated blinds, scentsy warmers, cameras, internet (search engines, social media, live streaming, etc.), and the list goes on. If we can learn to embrace technology and strengthen it, we can build stronger campaigns, better fundraisers, and ultimately help more people. I see technology and helping people as hand in hand.  


Why do you want to work here over somewhere else? 

I can take two things I’m passionate about, Technology and People to make the world a better place. 

Look at this list of tasks (https://gist.github.com/tommaitland/193b189f80d15309f4bfc475a3a7e81e) and tell us which two you are excited by, which two you want to learn and the two you don’t want to do. 

I am excited by calling new customers and working with developers to debug and resolve a product issue.

I want to learn changing the fonts and background colors on someone’s campaign and creating a new video tutorial on how to set up a campaign. 

I don’t want to do handling an upset customer worried about a missing feature and updating the developer docs.  
Tell us about a company who does customer support well, and why you think they’re good.

Good Customer support- multiple ways to connect with support- chat, phone, email. A positive outlook on the other line. Someone who takes an issue seriously. Someone that listens.
